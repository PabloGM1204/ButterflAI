It is one of the ‘leaf miner’ moths which means its larvae feed within the leaves of their foodplant, leaving characteristic blotches. It was first discovered near Macedonia in the 1980s and since then has quickly spread across Europe, reaching Britain in 2002. The larvae can cause serious defoliation of Horse Chestnut trees, however, this does not appear to do any long-lasting damage.",
